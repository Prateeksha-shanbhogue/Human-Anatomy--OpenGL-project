# OpenGL-VTU-mini-project-on-visualisation-of-Human-anatomay
This project is designed and implemented using OpenGL interactive application that basically deals with providing the graphical interfaces between user and system. The mini project "Human Anatomy" is the representation of different human physiology such as Respiration, Digestion and Excretion. Keyboard interface is used to select the particular Anatomy.
